    <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p><i>The Free Mind Project</i> aim to publish RPGs, games and comics on topics like <i>Philosophy, Literature, History, Social Sciences, etc.</i> And in multiple languages (Portuguese and English, for now). Because it's much more easy to learn you have fun. And also because it's so cool to have fun with what you learn.</p>
      <p><i>Our Mission</i> is to provide easy access to the most important discussions of humanity. And have fun during the process.</p>
